The MediaPipe Audio Classifier task lets you perform classification on audio data. You can
use this task to identify sound events from a set of trained categories. These
instructions show you how to use the Audio Classifier for Node and web apps.

You can see this task in action by viewing the
[demo](https://google-ai-edge.github.io/mediapipe-samples-web/#/audio/audio_classifier).
For more information about the capabilities, models, and configuration options
of this task, see the [Overview](https://developers.google.com/edge/mediapipe/solutions/audio/audio_classifier/index).

## Code example

The example code for Audio Classifier provides a complete implementation of this
task in JavaScript for your reference. This code helps you test this task and
get started on building your own audio classification app. You can view, run,
and edit the Audio Classifier
[example](https://stackblitz.com/https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples-web/)
using just your web browser.

## Setup

This section describes key steps for setting up your development environment and
code projects specifically to use Audio Classifier. For general information on
setting up your development environment for using MediaPipe tasks, including
platform version requirements, see the
[Setup guide for web](/mediapipe/solutions/setup_web).

### JavaScript packages

Audio Classifier code is available through the MediaPipe `@mediapipe/tasks-audio`
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40mediapipe) package. You can
find and download these libraries from links provided in the platform
[Setup guide](/mediapipe/solutions/setup_web#downloads).

**Attention:** This MediaPipe Solutions Preview is an early release.
[Learn more](/edge/mediapipe/solutions/about#notice).

You can install the required packages with the following code for local staging
using the following command:

```
npm install @mediapipe/tasks-audio
```

If you want to import the task code through a content delivery network (CDN)
service, add the following code in the  tag in your HTML file:

```
<!-- Replace "my-cdn-service.com" with your CDN -->
<head>
  <script src="https://my-cdn-service.com/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-audio/audio_bundle.js"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
```

### Model

The MediaPipe Audio Classifier task requires a trained model that is compatible with this
task. For more information on available trained models for Audio Classifier, see
the task overview [Models section](https://developers.google.com/edge/mediapipe/solutions/audio/audio_classifier/index#models).

Select and download a model, and then store it within your project directory,
for example:

```
<dev-project-root>/app/shared/models/
```

## Create the task

Use one of the Audio Classifier `createFrom...()` functions to
prepare the task for running inferences. Use the `createFromModelPath()`
function with a relative or absolute path to the trained model file.
If your model is already loaded into memory, you can use the
`createFromModelBuffer()` method.

The code example below demonstrates using the `createFromOptions()` function to
set up the task. The `createFromOptions` function allows you to customize the
Audio Classifier with configuration options. For more information on configuration
options, see [Configuration options](#configuration_options).

The following code demonstrates how to build and configure the task with custom
options:

```
const audio = await FilesetResolver.forAudioTasks(
    "https://my-cdn-service.com/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-audio/wasm"
  );

const audioClassifier = await AudioClassifier.createFromOptions(audio, {
    baseOptions: {
      modelAssetPath:
        "https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/yamnet/classification/tflite/1?lite-format=tflite"
    }
  });
```

You a see a full example at
[`example code`](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples-web/blob/main/src/workers/audio-classifier.worker.ts).

### Configuration options

This task has the following configuration options for Web and JavaScript
applications:

| Option Name | Description | Value Range | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `displayNamesLocale` | Sets the language of labels to use for display names provided in the metadata of the task's model, if available. Default is `en` for English. You can add localized labels to the metadata of a custom model using the [TensorFlow Lite Metadata Writer API](https://ai.google.dev/edge/lite/models/metadata_writer_tutorial#audio_classifiers) Locale code | en | |
| `maxResults` | Sets the optional maximum number of top-scored classification results to return. If < 0, all available results will be returned. | Any positive numbers | `-1` |
| `scoreThreshold` | Sets the prediction score threshold that overrides the one provided in the model metadata (if any). Results below this value are rejected. | [0.0, 1.0] | Not set |
| `categoryAllowlist` | Sets the optional list of allowed category names. If non-empty, classification results whose category name is not in this set will be filtered out. Duplicate or unknown category names are ignored. This option is mutually exclusive with `categoryDenylist` and using both results in an error. | Any strings | Not set |
| `categoryDenylist` | Sets the optional list of category names that are not allowed. If non-empty, classification results whose category name is in this set will be filtered out. Duplicate or unknown category names are ignored. This option is mutually exclusive with `categoryAllowlist` and using both results in an error. | Any strings | Not set |

## Prepare data

Audio Classifier works with audio clips and audio streams, and can work with audio
files in any format supported by the host browser. The task handles the data
input preprocessing, including resampling, buffering, and framing.

## Run the task

The Audio Classifier uses the `classify()` method to run inferences for audio clip
files or audio streams. The Audio Classifier API returns the possible
categories for audio events recognized in the input audio.

Calls to the Audio Classifier `classify()` method run synchronously and blocks the
user interface thread. If you classify audio from a device's microphone,
each classification will block the main thread. You can prevent this by
implementing web workers to run `classify()` on another thread.

The following code demonstrates how to execute the processing with the task model:

### Audio clips

```
// Create audio buffer
const sample = await response.arrayBuffer();
const audioBuffer = await audioCtx.decodeAudioData(sample);

// Use AudioClassifier to run classification
const results = audioClassifier.classify(
  audioBuffer.getChannelData(0),
  audioBuffer.sampleRate
);
```

### Audio stream

```
stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints);
audioCtx = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 16000 });

const source = audioCtx.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
const scriptNode = audioCtx.createScriptProcessor(16384, 1, 1);

scriptNode.onaudioprocess = function (audioProcessingEvent) {
  const inputBuffer = audioProcessingEvent.inputBuffer;
  let inputData = inputBuffer.getChannelData(0);

  // Classify the audio
  const result = audioClassifier.classify(inputData);
  const categories = result[0].classifications[0].categories;
};
```

For a more complete implementation of running an Audio Classifier task, see the
[example](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples-web/blob/main/src/workers/audio-classifier.worker.ts).

## Handle and display results

Once you complete an inference run, the Audio Classifier task returns an
`AudioClassifierResult` object which contains the list of possible categories
for the objects within the input audio.

```
AudioClassifierResult:
  Timestamp in microseconds: 100
  ClassificationResult #0:
    Timestamp in microseconds: 100  
    Classifications #0 (single classification head):
      head index: 0
      category #0:
        category name: "Speech"
        score: 0.6
        index: 0
      category #1:
        category name: "Music"
        score: 0.2
        index: 1
```

The Audio Classifier example code demonstrates how to display the classification
results returned from the task, see the
[example](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples-web/blob/main/src/tasks/audio-classifier.ts)
for details.
