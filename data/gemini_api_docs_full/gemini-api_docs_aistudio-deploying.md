# Deploying from Google AI Studio

[//]: # (source: [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/aistudio-deploying))

The [Interactions API](/gemini-api/docs/interactions-overview) is now generally available. We recommend using this API for access to all the latest features and models.

Google AI Studio lets you to deploy your full-stack applications directly
from Build Mode. This provides a fast path from prototype to a
managed, scalable production environment.

## Deployment options

To deploy your application from AI Studio Build Mode, the requirements depend
on the tier you use:

* [**Google Cloud Starter Tier**](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/starter-tier):
  Lets you publish up to 2 full-stack applications without setting up a
  Google Cloud project or billing account.
* **Standard Deployment**: Requires a Google Cloud project linked to your
  AI Studio account and billing enabled on that project.

## About the Starter Tier

The Google Cloud Starter Tier provides a streamlined path to deploy
applications to Google Cloud directly from Google AI Studio without setting
up a full Google Cloud environment or billing account.

Each Google AI Studio deployment creates a corresponding service in
Cloud Run. For services deployed in Google AI Studio with Starter
Tier, the following limitations apply:

* You can deploy up to two services.
* Your services are deployed in a
  [single Cloud Run region](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/locations).

**Note:** Users with active or prior Google Cloud billing accounts are ineligible to use the starter tier. Enterprise accounts associated with a paid or free Google Workspace, Google Workspace for Education, or Google for Nonprofits subscription are also ineligible.

## Starter Tier deployment steps

After designing your app in Build mode, deploy it with Starter Tier:

1. Click the **Publish** button in the top right corner.
2. Click **Get Started**.
3. Click **Publish App**.

Once deployment is complete, AI Studio provides a Cloud Run URL where you can
access your live application.

**Note:** If you already have 2 applications deployed, you will be asked to either
unpublish one of the applications or upgrade to a paid account. You may
also need to upgrade to a paid account if you don't have starter tier
available.

## Custom URLs for AI Studio

When publishing an application from Google AI Studio, you can set a custom,
memorable subdomain under `ai.studio` (for example,
`https://your-app-name.ai.studio`).

Google AI Studio requires subdomains to be globally unique across all projects,
and assigns them on a first-come, first-served basis. If another project
already uses a name, AI Studio prompts you to choose a different one. If you
unpublish or delete an application, its custom URL is released and becomes
available for other users to claim.

### Set a custom URL

To set or update a custom URL for your application:

1. Open your application in Google AI Studio in **Build** mode.
2. Click **Publish** in the top right corner.
3. In the deployment configuration, enter your preferred subdomain in the
   **Custom URL** field or accept the suggested URL.
4. Click **Publish App**.

To transfer an existing custom URL to a different application, you must first
unpublish or delete the application which is assigned that custom URL, and then
publish your new application using the chosen subdomain.

### Report trademark or copyright issues

Custom subdomains must comply with the
[Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms). If you notice a
custom URL that infringes on a trademark or uses a copyrighted name without
permission, you can report it using the
[Google Legal Troubleshooter](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905).

## Standard deployment

As your applications evolve, you might require capabilities beyond the Starter
Tier, such as higher quotas or increased compute resources or other
Google Cloud products not available in the Starter Tier. To unlock
these capabilities, you can convert your fully managed Starter Tier project into
a standard Google Cloud project.

This ensures that you can scale seamlessly without losing
your progress. Follow the steps to
[create a Cloud Billing account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/create-billing-account#create-new-billing-account),
formally accept the standard Google Cloud Terms of Service, and
[upgrade to a standard Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/starter-tier#upgradee).
For more information, see
[Setup for Paid accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/in-product-billing-setup#paid-setup).

To learn more about billing tiers, see [Billing](/gemini-api/docs/billing).

## Delete your application

If you no longer need your app, you can delete it in Google AI Studio
by following these instructions:

1. In Google AI Studio, go to your
   [Apps page](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apps).
2. In the left menu, select **Apps**.
3. Hold the pointer over the app you want to delete.
4. Click the trash can icon on the right-side of the row to delete the app.
