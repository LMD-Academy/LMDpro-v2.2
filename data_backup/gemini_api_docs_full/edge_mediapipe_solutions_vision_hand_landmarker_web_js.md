# Hand landmarks detection guide for Web Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.



The MediaPipe Hand Landmarker task lets you detect the landmarks of the hands in an image.
These instructions show you how to use the Hand Landmarker
for web and JavaScript apps.

For more information about the capabilities, models, and configuration options
of this task, see the [Overview](https://developers.google.com/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker/index).

## Code example

The example code for Hand Landmarker provides a complete implementation of this
task in JavaScript for your reference. This code helps you test this task and get
started on building your own hand landmark detection app. You can view, run, and
edit the Hand Landmarker
[example](https://stackblitz.com/https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples-web/)
using just your web browser.

## Setup

This section describes key steps for setting up your development environment
specifically to use Hand Landmarker. For general information on
setting up your web and JavaScript development environment, including
platform version requirements, see the
[Setup guide for web](/mediapipe/solutions/setup_web).

### JavaScript packages

Hand Landmarker code is available through the MediaPipe `@mediapipe/tasks-vision`
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40mediapipe) package. You can
find and download these libraries by following the instructions in the platform
[Setup guide](/mediapipe/solutions/setup_web#downloads).

**Attention:** This MediaPipe Solutions Preview is an early release.
[Learn more](/edge/mediapipe/solutions/about#notice).

You can install the required packages through NPM
using the following command:

```
npm install @mediapipe/tasks-vision
```

If you want to import the task code via a content delivery network (CDN)
service, add the following code in the <head> tag in your HTML file:

```
<!-- You can replace JSDeliver with another CDN if you prefer to -->
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision/vision_bundle.mjs"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
```

### Model

The MediaPipe Hand Landmarker task requires a trained model that is compatible with this
task. For more information on available trained models for Hand Landmarker, see
the task overview [Models section](https://developers.google.com/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker/index#models).

Select and download a model, and then store it within your project directory:

```
<dev-project-root>/app/shared/models/
```

## Create the task

Use one of the Hand Landmarker `createFrom...()` functions to
prepare the task for running inferences. Use the `createFromModelPath()`
function with a relative or absolute path to the trained model file.
If your model is already loaded into memory, you can use the
`createFromModelBuffer()` method.

The code example below demonstrates using the `createFromOptions()` function to
set up the task. The `createFromOptions` function allows you to customize the
Hand Landmarker with configuration options. For more information on configuration
options, see [Configuration options](#configuration_options).

The following code demonstrates how to build and configure the task with custom
options:

```
const vision = await FilesetResolver.forVisionTasks(
  // path/to/wasm/root
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision@latest/wasm"
);
const handLandmarker = await HandLandmarker.createFromOptions(
    vision,
    {
      baseOptions: {
        modelAssetPath: "hand_landmarker.task"
      },
      numHands: 2
    });
```

### Configuration options

This task has the following configuration options for Web and JavaScript
applications:

| Option Name | Description | Value Range | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `runningMode` | Sets the running mode for the task. There are two modes:    IMAGE: The mode for single image inputs.    VIDEO: The mode for decoded frames of a video or on a livestream of input data, such as from a camera. | {`IMAGE, VIDEO`} | `IMAGE` |
| `numHands` | The maximum number of hands detected by the Hand landmark detector. | `Any integer > 0` | `1` |
| `minHandDetectionConfidence` | The minimum confidence score for the hand detection to be considered successful in palm detection model. | `0.0 - 1.0` | `0.5` |
| `minHandPresenceConfidence` | The minimum confidence score for the hand presence score in the hand landmark detection model. In Video mode and Live stream mode, if the hand presence confidence score from the hand landmark model is below this threshold, Hand Landmarker triggers the palm detection model. Otherwise, a lightweight hand tracking algorithm determines the location of the hand(s) for subsequent landmark detections. | `0.0 - 1.0` | `0.5` |
| `minTrackingConfidence` | The minimum confidence score for the hand tracking to be considered successful. This is the bounding box IoU threshold between hands in the current frame and the last frame. In Video mode and Stream mode of Hand Landmarker, if the tracking fails, Hand Landmarker triggers hand detection. Otherwise, it skips the hand detection. | `0.0 - 1.0` | `0.5` |

## Prepare data

Hand Landmarker can detect hand landmarks in images in any format supported by the
host browser. The task also handles data input preprocessing, including
resizing, rotation and value normalization. To detect hand landmarks in videos,
you can use the API to quickly process one frame at a time, using the timestamp
of the frame to determine when the hand landmarks occur within the video.

## Run the task

The Hand Landmarker uses the `detect()` (with running mode `image`) and
`detectForVideo()` (with running mode `video`) methods to trigger
inferences. The task processes the data, attempts to detect hand landmarks, and
then reports the results.

Calls to the Hand Landmarker `detect()` and `detectForVideo()` methods run
synchronously and block the user interface thread. If you detect hand landmarks
in video frames from a device's camera, each detection blocks the main
thread. You can prevent this by implementing web workers to run the `detect()`
and `detectForVideo()` methods on another thread.

The following code demonstrates how execute the processing with the task model:

### Image

```
const image = document.getElementById("image") as HTMLImageElement;
const handLandmarkerResult = handLandmarker.detect(image);
```

### Video

```
await handLandmarker.setOptions({ runningMode: "video" });

let lastVideoTime = -1;
function renderLoop(): void {
  const video = document.getElementById("video");

  if (video.currentTime !== lastVideoTime) {
    const detections = handLandmarker.detectForVideo(video);
    processResults(detections);
    lastVideoTime = video.currentTime;
  }

  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    renderLoop();
  });
}
```

For a more complete implementation of running an Hand Landmarker task, see the
[example](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples-web/blob/main/src/workers/hand-landmarker.worker.ts).

## Handle and display results

The Hand Landmarker generates a hand landmarker result object for each detection
run. The result object contains hand landmarks in image coordinates, hand
landmarks in world coordinates and handedness(left/right hand) of the detected
hands.

The following shows an example of the output data from this task:

The `HandLandmarkerResult` output contains three components. Each component is an array, where each element contains the following results for a single detected hand:

* Handedness

  Handedness represents whether the detected hands are left or right hands.
* Landmarks

  There are 21 hand landmarks, each composed of `x`, `y` and `z` coordinates. The
  `x` and `y` coordinates are normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image width and
  height, respectively. The `z` coordinate represents the landmark depth, with
  the depth at the wrist being the origin. The smaller the value, the closer the
  landmark is to the camera. The magnitude of `z` uses roughly the same scale as
  `x`.
* World Landmarks

  The 21 hand landmarks are also presented in world coordinates. Each landmark
  is composed of `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing real-world 3D coordinates in
  meters with the origin at the hand’s geometric center.
