DiffusionGemma is an experimental open model that explores text diffusion, an exceptionally fast approach to text generation. Based on the 26B (4B active) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Gemma 4 architecture, DiffusionGemma generates tokens using discrete diffusion.

**Note:** This notebook requires a GPU which has more than 60GB of memory such as NVIDIA G4 or NVIDIA H100.

## Install Python packages

Install the Hugging Face libraries required for running the DiffusionGemma model and making requests.

```
# Install PyTorch & other libraries
pip install torch accelerate

# Install the transformers library
pip install "transformers>=5.11.0"
```

## Load Model

Use `transformers` library to load the model.

```
from transformers import DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion, AutoProcessor

MODEL_ID = "google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it"

model = DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion.from_pretrained(
    MODEL_ID, dtype="auto", device_map="auto",
)

Use a prompt template to structure your request. A prompt template allows you to specify input from specific roles, such as `user` or `model`, and is a required format for managing multi-turn chat interactions with Gemma models.

```
message = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Why is the sky blue?"}
]

input_ids = processor.apply_chat_template(message, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
output = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=512)

Why is the sky blue?<turn|>
<|turn>model

<channel|>The sky is blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

### 1. Sunlight is made of all colors
Although sunlight looks white to us, it is actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). Each color travels as a wave with a different wavelength.

### 2. The atmosphere is an obstacle
The Earth’s atmosphere is filled with gases (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it hits the gas molecules and scat in all directions.

### 3. Short waves scatter more
Different colors interact with the gas molecules differently based on their wavelength:

*   **Red and yellow light** have long, lazy waves. They pass through the atmosphere easily without hitting many molecules.
*   **Blue and violet light** have shorter, choppier waves. When these waves hit the gas molecules, they get scattered (bounced) in every direction.

### 4. Our eyes see blue
Because the blue light is being scattered everywhere in the upper atmosphere, when you look up, your eyes catch that scattered blue light coming from every angle.

### Why isn't the sky violet?
Technically, violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue light and scatters even more. However, we don't see a violet sky for two reasons:

1. Sunlight emits much more blue light than violet light.
2. Human eyes are much more sensitive to blue than to violet.

### What about sunsets?
When the sun is setting, the light has to travel through much more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach your eyes. By the time the light gets to you, the blue light has been scattered away completely, leaving only the long-wavelength **reds and oranges** to pass through.<turn|><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

### 1. Sunlight is a rainbow of colors
While sunlight looks white to us, it is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). Each color travels as a wave with a different wavelength:

*   **Red light** has long, lazy waves.
*   **Blue and violet light** have short, choppy waves.

### 2. The atmosphere is an obstacle course
The Earth is surrounded by an atmosphere filled with gases (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). When sunlight hits the atmosphere, it strikes the gas molecules and gets scattered in all directions.

### 3. Short waves scatter more
The long-wavelength colors (red and yellow) pass through the atmosphere relatively undisturbed, without hitting much. However, the **shorter waves** (blue and violet) strike the gas molecules and are scattered in every direction. 

### 4. Why do we see blue and not violet?
Since the blue light is being scattered everywhere in the upper atmosphere, when you look up, your eyes are catching that scattered blue light coming from every part of the sky.

You might wonder why the sky isn't violet, since violet has an even shorter wavelength than blue. There are two reasons:

1.  **The Sun:** The Sun emits much more blue light than violet light.
2.  **Human Vision:** Our eyes are much more sensitive to blue. Our brains interpret the mixture of scattered violet and blue as pale blue.

### What about sunsets?
When the sun is setting, the light has to travel through much more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach your eyes. By the time the light gets to you, the blue has been scattered away entirely, leaving only the long-wavelength **reds and oranges** to pass through.<turn|><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>
